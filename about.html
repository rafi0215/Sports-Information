        Cricket: The game of cricket originated in south-east England sometime in the late 16th century. By the 18th century, it had become the national sport, making inroads globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. The prototype for the modern cricket bat featuring a willow blade and a cane handle layered with strips of rubber, and then tied with twine and covered with another layer of rubber to form a grip was invented around 1853.The longest recorded game of cricket took place in 1939 and spanned a period of nine days.Cricket is played on either circular or oval shaped grounds. There is a rectangular area in the middle of the ground, called the pitch, which is the most important part of the field. On the pitch, all the bowling and batting takes place. A set of wooden sticks, called stumps and bails, is placed on both ends of the pitch. A cricket ball; made of wood and leather, and a wooden bat are required to play the sport. The batsmen wear a full set of protective gear. In the traditional form of the game, a match is played between two teams, with 11 players on each team, in an innings format. One team gets to bat while the other team bowls and fields. The collection of all the overs that a team bats for, is called an innings. The team that bats first, tries to score as many runs as possible. After the two teams have played their innings, the team with the most runs is the winner.

       Badminton: Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes over the net.The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to other racket sports. As the shuttlecock flight is stubbornly affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game. Since 1992, badminton has been an Olympic sport with five events: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles, in which each pair is a man and a woman. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racket movements.

       Tennis: Tennis is a game in which two individuals, or four doubles team members, hit a ball with their rackets over a net that stretches the width of the court. The game has evolved as a game from ancient times to the modern game we play and watch today. When was tennis created? The game has changed from the court tennis game played by French monks and nobility in the medieval period, to the modernized lawn tennis developed in England in the late 1800s. In the 21st century, the game of tennis is more popular than ever. While it has changed greatly from the monks who hit balls across the net of an indoor court with the palms of their hands, the game still retains many of the aspects of the medieval game. Modern tennis looks very similar to the game played in 1800s England. Tennis has been part of European life for over a thousand years and is significant to their culture, and now to the sports culture of the modern world.
